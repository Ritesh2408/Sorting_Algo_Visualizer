### **Project Name:**
# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
#### About Project:
- This is a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer implemented using C programming language with GUI.

- For compiling and linking all the graphics to your file , for that use: 

  ```gcc -Wall -O2 filename.c -lcsfml-graphics -lcsfml-window -o filename```
  
    (```-lcsfml-graphics``` to link executable with csfml-graphics library and ```-lcsfml-window``` with csfml-window library.)
    
- Run the executable file, for that use :
  ```./filename```
  
  **For Windows** , Visual Studio is required, any suggestions on how to compile CSFML on windows are most welcome :).
